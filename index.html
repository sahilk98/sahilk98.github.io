	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sahil Kumar!</h1>
	<p>Welcome to this page, and I hope you have a wonderful day ! </p>
	<p>This is my first ever website, and it also is my first HTML project. As I learn more about HTML, I will be adding more projects and features to this website. </p>
	<p>Being a self-taught programmer who codes primarily using Python, I hope to be able to use this website as a platform or an online portfolio to showcase my work. </p>
	<p>You can access some of my projects by clicking on the link below. In the future, I hope to include more projects and divide them by subsections (different pages for
		Data Analysis, Machine Learning, SQL, or normal Python projects), and make the layout better in general. Thank you for visiting!! </p>
	<p><a href="/portfolio">About my projects...</a></p>
